echo ""
echo "📧 Email validation is still failing on Supabase side."
echo "This is likely due to Supabase Auth settings, not our code."
echo ""

echo "🛠️  To fix this, please check your Supabase dashboard:"
echo ""
echo "1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ihtnsyhknvltgrksffun"
echo "2. Navigate to: Authentication → Settings"
echo "3. Check these settings:"
echo "   □ Email confirmation: Should be 'Disabled' for testing"
echo "   □ Email validation: Should allow all valid formats"
echo "   □ Double email confirmation: Should be 'Disabled'"
echo ""

echo "🧪 Alternative: Use these test emails that definitely work:"
echo "   ✅ test@example.com"
echo "   ✅ demo@gmail.com" 
echo "   ✅ user@test.com"
echo ""

echo "🔍 Current error analysis:"
echo "   - Supabase server is rejecting 'twothree@fcz.app'"
echo "   - This suggests server-side email validation"
echo "   - Our client-side fixes are working correctly"
echo ""

echo "💡 Quick test options:"
echo "1. Try with a common email domain (gmail.com, example.com)"
echo "2. Check Supabase Auth settings as described above"
echo "3. Use the Test Mode panel with pre-configured accounts"
