- **Files Modified**:
  - `client/src/store/clubStore.ts` - Complete rewrite with relative URLs
  - `server/src/routes/clubs.ts` - Enhanced error handling and authentication
  - `.env` - Added VITE_API_URL configuration
- **Technical Details**:
  - Vite proxy configured to forward `/api` requests to `http://localhost:3001`
  - All club operations now properly route through backend server
  - Improved error logging for debugging
  - Added server health check script (`check-server.js`)
- **Testing Status**: Ready for user testing - join club functionality should now work correctly

## Technical Decisions Made
