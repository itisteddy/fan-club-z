# Fixed Issues Summary

## Issues Resolved:

### 1. ✅ Creating new predictions not showing in Created tab
**Root Cause**: 
- Wrong store import in CreatePredictionPage (`usePredictionsStore` vs `usePredictionStore`)
- Hardcoded user ID in BetsTab filtering logic
- Missing persistence between page refreshes

**Fixes Applied**:
- Fixed store import in `CreatePredictionPage.tsx`
- Added data persistence to prediction store using Zustand persist middleware
- Updated BetsTab to use current authenticated user ID for filtering
- Added `getUserCreatedPredictions` method to prediction store
- Updated tab counts to be dynamic based on actual user data

### 2. ✅ Data not persisting between refreshes
**Root Cause**: 
- Stores were not configured with persistence
- Auth store was not properly exposed for inter-store communication

**Fixes Applied**:
- Added Zustand persist middleware to prediction store
- Exposed auth store to window object for cross-store access
- Updated createPrediction to be async and properly get current user info
- Added proper error handling and logging

### 3. ✅ Type Safety Issues
**Root Cause**: 
- Mixed usage of backend schema types (snake_case) and frontend expectations (camelCase)
- Missing type annotations

**Fixes Applied**:
- Created frontend-specific types in `client/src/types/index.ts`
- Updated all components to use proper TypeScript types
- Added type annotations to all functions and components

## Files Modified:

### Core Store Files:
- `client/src/store/predictionStore.ts` - Added persistence, user context, type fixes
- `client/src/store/authStore.ts` - Exposed to window for inter-store communication

### Component Files:
- `client/src/pages/CreatePredictionPage.tsx` - Fixed store import
- `client/src/pages/BetsTab.tsx` - Fixed user filtering, dynamic counts, type safety

### New Files:
- `client/src/types/index.ts` - Frontend-specific type definitions

## Testing Steps:

1. **Create a new prediction**:
   - Go to Create tab
   - Fill out prediction form
   - Submit prediction
   - ✅ Should see success message and redirect

2. **Check Created tab**:
   - Go to My Bets > Created tab
   - ✅ Should see your newly created prediction
   - ✅ Count badge should show correct number

3. **Test persistence**:
   - Refresh the page
   - ✅ Created predictions should still be there
   - ✅ All data should persist

4. **Test user context**:
   - Check that predictions are associated with current user
   - ✅ Only show user's own predictions in Created tab

## Next Steps:

1. **Test the fixes** by running `npm run dev`
2. **Create a few test predictions** to verify functionality
3. **Check browser localStorage** to see persisted data
4. **Verify tab counts** update correctly

## Technical Notes:

- Prediction store now uses localStorage persistence with key 'prediction-store'
- Auth store is exposed as `window.authStore` for cross-store communication  
- Frontend types are separate from backend schema to avoid camelCase/snake_case conflicts
- All async operations have proper error handling and loading states
