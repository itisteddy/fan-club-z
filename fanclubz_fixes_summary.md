# Fan Club Z v2.0 - Issues Fixed & Testing Report

## Issues Identified & Fixed

### ✅ Issue 1: Registration Link Not Working

**Problem**: The "Create one now" link in the login page was not functional - it had `onClick={(e) => e.preventDefault()}` which blocked the action.

**Solution Implemented**:
1. **Enhanced AuthPage Component**: 
   - Added state management for switching between login and registration modes
   - Implemented `isLoginMode` state with `toggleMode()` function
   - Added form fields for registration: firstName, lastName, confirmPassword
   - Added proper form validation for registration fields
   - Updated UI to dynamically show different content based on mode

2. **Updated Auth Store**: 
   - Added `register()` function to handle user registration
   - Implemented mock registration logic for development
   - User registration now creates account and automatically logs in

3. **Enhanced UX Features**:
   - Dynamic form title and description based on mode
   - Smooth form transitions between login/registration
   - Enhanced validation with real-time error messages
   - Password confirmation field for registration
   - Social authentication for both login and registration

**Key Changes Made**:
```typescript
// Added registration functionality to auth store
register: (email: string, password: string, firstName: string, lastName: string) => {
  const user = {
    id: Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 9),
    firstName: firstName,
    lastName: lastName,
    email: email,
  };
  set({ isAuthenticated: true, user });
}

// Enhanced AuthPage with mode switching
const [isLoginMode, setIsLoginMode] = useState(true);
const toggleMode = () => {
  setIsLoginMode(!isLoginMode);
  // Clear form state
};
```
