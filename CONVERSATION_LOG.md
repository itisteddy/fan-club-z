## Key Conversations & Updates

### Comments API Architecture Fix (Current Session)
- **Date**: [Current Date]
- **Focus**: Resolving 404 errors on comments API endpoints causing console flooding
- **Root Cause Analysis**: API endpoint misalignment between frontend and backend
  1. Frontend hooks using inconsistent endpoint patterns
  2. Missing comprehensive route coverage in backend
  3. Terminology update created endpoint inconsistencies
  4. Server route mounting not properly aligned

#### Key Fixes Applied:

**1. Frontend API Consistency**
- âœ… Fixed useComments.ts to use consistent `/social/` prefix for all endpoints
- âœ… Updated create comment from `/social/comments` to `/social/predictions/{id}/comments`
- âœ… Fixed edit endpoint to `/social/comments/{id}`
- âœ… Fixed delete endpoint to `/social/comments/{id}`
- âœ… Fixed like endpoint to `/social/comments/{id}/like`
- âœ… Added missing replies endpoint `/social/comments/{id}/replies`

**2. Backend Route Enhancement**
- âœ… Completely rewrote comments.ts with comprehensive logging
- âœ… Added all missing CRUD endpoints for comments
- âœ… Enhanced error handling and debugging information
- âœ… Proper route parameter validation and error responses
- âœ… Added comprehensive catch-all handler for debugging

**3. Architecture Alignment**
- âœ… Ensured all frontend calls match backend route structure
- âœ… Consistent use of prediction-based comment endpoints
- âœ… Proper error handling and fallback mechanisms
- âœ… Enhanced logging for debugging API issues

### React Architecture Debugging & Error Fixes (Previous Session)
- **Date**: [Previous Date]
- **Focus**: Fixing "o is not a function" error in DiscoverPage.tsx and related TypeScript issues
- **Root Cause Analysis**: The error was caused by:
  1. Missing `refreshPredictions` method in predictionStore.ts
  2. Missing `lockFunds` method in walletStore.ts 
  3. Incomplete interface definitions after terminology update
  4. Function call mismatches between components and stores

#### Key Fixes Applied:

**1. PredictionStore Updates**
- âœ… Added missing `refreshPredictions` method with proper caching logic
- âœ… Fixed `placePrediction` method signature to match usage in components
- âœ… Updated interface to include all required methods
- âœ… Improved error handling and fallback mechanisms

**2. WalletStore Updates**
- âœ… Added missing `lockFunds` method for prediction placement
- âœ… Enhanced wallet initialization with demo balance fallback ($1000)
- âœ… Fixed transaction recording and balance management
- âœ… Improved error handling for insufficient funds scenarios

**3. PlacePredictionModal Fixes**
- âœ… Fixed missing function imports and declarations
- âœ… Added proper error handling for user authentication
- âœ… Implemented correct wallet integration with lockFunds
- âœ… Fixed formatTimeRemaining function implementation

**4. Component Architecture Improvements**
- âœ… Enhanced error boundaries and fallback states
- âœ… Improved TypeScript type safety across all components
- âœ… Fixed circular dependency issues
- âœ… Added proper loading and error states

### Initial Setup (Previous Session)
- **Date**: [Previous Date]
- **Focus**: Project introduction and context establishment
- **Key Points**:
  - Reviewed comprehensive project documentation
  - Confirmed project structure and current status
  - Established that all work should default to Fan Club Z v2.0 context
  - Created intro summary for future conversation context

### Terminology Update (Previous Session)
- **Date**: [Previous Date]
- **Focus**: Major terminology update throughout platform
- **Key Changes**:
  - Updated all "betting" terminology to "predictions" for broader palatability
  - Created comprehensive terminology guide for implementation
  - Updated main project documentation with new terminology
  - This affects UI, API endpoints, database schema, and all user-facing content
- **Rationale**: Make platform more accessible and less intimidating to mainstream users

### Comprehensive UI/UX Style Guide Creation (Previous Session)
- **Date**: July 27, 2025
- **Focus**: Complete UI/UX design system documentation
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - Comprehensive style guide incorporating iTunes/Robinhood aesthetics
  - Social engagement patterns from X/Twitter and WhatsApp
  - Detailed component library with all variants and states
  - Advanced animation system and micro-interactions
  - Psychological engagement triggers (subtly implemented)
  - Dark mode implementation guidelines
  - Advanced responsive design patterns
  - Complete accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA)
  - Performance optimization guidelines

## Technical Decisions Made
- **State Management**: Zustand chosen for simplicity and performance
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui with custom green theme (#22c55e)
- **Architecture**: Microservices with PostgreSQL + Redis + smart contracts
- **Mobile-First**: Bottom navigation, touch-optimized interactions
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error boundaries with graceful fallbacks
- **Demo Data**: Wallet starts with $1000 for immediate user testing
