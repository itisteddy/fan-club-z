- [ ] Graceful degradation for unsupported features

### **Performance Benchmarks**

#### **Core Web Vitals**
- [ ] Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) < 2.5s
- [ ] First Input Delay (FID) < 100ms  
- [ ] Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) < 0.1

#### **Bundle Size**
- [ ] Main bundle < 500KB gzipped
- [ ] Individual route chunks < 200KB
- [ ] Critical CSS < 50KB
- [ ] Images optimized (WebP, lazy loading)

## Automated Testing Strategy

### **Unit Tests**
- Utility functions (formatters, validators)
- Custom hooks (useComponentLifecycle, useAuthSession)  
- Component logic (calculation functions)
- Store actions and reducers

### **Integration Tests**
- API endpoints and error handling
- Authentication flows
- Form submissions and validations
- Real-time features (comments, likes)

### **End-to-End Tests**
- Critical user journeys (sign up → create prediction → place bet)
- Payment flows (add funds → bet → withdraw)
- Mobile navigation patterns
- Cross-browser compatibility

### **Visual Regression Tests**
- Component screenshots across breakpoints
- Dark mode compatibility
- Loading states and animations
- Error states and empty states

## Test Environment Setup

### **Local Development**
```bash
# Install test dependencies
npm install --save-dev @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom
npm install --save-dev playwright @playwright/test
npm install --save-dev @storybook/react @storybook/addon-accessibility

# Run test suites
npm run test:unit
npm run test:e2e
npm run test:accessibility
```
