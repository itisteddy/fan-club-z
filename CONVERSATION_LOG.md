## Key Conversations & Updates

### Comment Count Inconsistencies Fix (Current Session)
- **Date**: August 19, 2025
- **Focus**: Fixed comment count inconsistencies between BetCard and CommentModal
- **Issue Identified**:
  - BetCard was using the new `unifiedCommentStore.ts` (API-based)
  - CommentModal was using the old `commentStore.ts` (Supabase-based)
  - This caused comment counts to display incorrectly (often showing 0)
  - Two different stores weren't syncing properly
- **Solution Implemented**:
  - Updated CommentModal to use `useCommentsForPrediction` hook from unified store
  - Replaced all references to old comment store methods
  - Fixed comment count display to use `commentCount` from unified store
  - Updated like functionality to use `toggleCommentLike` method
  - Ensured proper loading and submission states
- **Files Modified**:
  - `/client/src/components/modals/CommentModal.tsx` - Updated to use unified store
- **Result**: Comment counts now display consistently across all components
