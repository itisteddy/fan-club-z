# Software Architecture Debugging - Comprehensive Fix Implementation

**Status**: IMPLEMENTING SYSTEMATIC FIXES
**Target**: Fix all 6 critical issues while preserving user experience

## Issue #1: Username Click Error ✅ IMPLEMENTING

The error occurs because the `prediction.creator` object structure is inconsistent. Let me fix this by:

1. Enhanced TappableUsername component (✅ DONE)
2. Fixing PredictionDetailsPage creator navigation (⏳ IN PROGRESS)
3. Ensuring data consistency in prediction store (⏳ PENDING)

## Issue #2: Mock Data in Likes & Comments ✅ IDENTIFIED

Current status shows likes/comments are using Supabase but with potential data synchronization issues. Need to:

1. Remove any remaining mock fallbacks
2. Ensure real-time synchronization 
3. Fix persistence across page refreshes

## Issue #3: Mock Analytics & Statistics ✅ IDENTIFIED  

Platform stats showing "Volume: $0, Live: 0, Players: 0" suggests:

1. API endpoint working but calculations incorrect
2. Real data not being aggregated properly
3. Need dynamic calculation from actual predictions

## Issue #4: Live Market Stats Not Updating ✅ IDENTIFIED

Platform stats endpoint exists but values are static. Need:

1. Real-time calculation of active predictions
2. Dynamic volume calculation from actual pool totals
3. Live user count from authentic registrations

## Issue #5: Version Number Inconsistency ✅ IDENTIFIED

Multiple hardcoded version strings. Need:

1. Single source of truth for version
2. Automatic version propagation
3. Build-time version injection

## Issue #6: TypeScript Server Compilation ✅ IDENTIFIED

Server index.ts has some type issues. Need:

1. Clean import/export paths
2. Proper type definitions
3. Module resolution fixes

## IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

1. Fix username navigation first (highest priority UX issue)
2. Remove mock data and ensure real persistence
3. Fix platform statistics calculation
4. Standardize version management
5. Resolve TypeScript compilation issues
6. Test all fixes systematically
