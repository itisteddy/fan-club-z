# Fixes Applied - September 29, 2025

## Issue Summary
Fixed 4 critical UI/UX issues reported by the user:

### 1. ✅ Balance Not Reporting Correctly
**Problem:** Users couldn't see their balance when placing bets, causing confusion about available funds.

**Solution:**
- Updated `BetDetailPage.tsx` to display balance information prominently
- Added a dedicated balance card showing:
  - Available balance (bold, large text)
  - Reserved balance (when applicable, in amber color)
- Imported `totalBalance` and `reservedBalance` from `useWalletStore()`
- Enhanced "Place Bet" button to show "Insufficient Balance" when stake exceeds available funds
- Added validation to disable betting when balance is insufficient

**Files Modified:**
- `/client/src/pages/BetDetailPage.tsx`

### 2. ✅ Place Bet Button Positioning
**Problem:** Place Bet button was partially hidden behind bottom navigation on various devices.

**Solution:**
- Added explicit positioning styles to the Place Bet button:
  ```css
  position: relative;
  z-index: 40;
  margin-bottom: calc(env(safe-area-inset-bottom) + 80px);
  ```
- This ensures the button stays above the bottom navigation (z-index: 30)
- Added safe area inset for proper spacing on devices with notches/home indicators
- The 80px accounts for the bottom nav height plus padding

**Files Modified:**
- `/client/src/pages/BetDetailPage.tsx`

### 3. ✅ Onboarding Tutorial Updated
**Problem:** Tutorial was pointing to outdated UI elements that no longer exist.

**Solution:**
- Removed reference to non-existent "live-markets" target
- Updated PREDICTION_DETAILS_TOUR to match current UI:
  - Removed "tabs-navigation" (doesn't exist in current design)
  - Updated to focus on: prediction details → options → stake input → comments
  - All steps now use 'modal' action type for better UX (centered, full attention)
- Simplified DISCOVER_PAGE_TOUR to focus on existing elements:
  - Welcome → Search → Categories → Prediction List
- Updated descriptions to match current UI terminology

**Files Modified:**
- `/client/src/config/onboardingTours.tsx`

### 4. ✅ Category Filter Pills Size Reduction
**Problem:** Category filter pills were too tall (36px/32px), taking up excessive vertical space.

**Solution:**
- Reduced pill height from 36px to 28px (desktop)
- Reduced pill height from 32px to 26px (mobile)
- Adjusted padding accordingly:
  - Desktop: `padding: 4px 12px` (was 8px 16px)
  - Mobile: `padding: 4px 10px` (was 6px 12px)
- Reduced border radius to match new height (14px/13px instead of 18px/16px)
- Reduced font size slightly for better proportion (13px/12px instead of 14px/13px)
- Pills now fit more content in less vertical space while maintaining readability

**Files Modified:**
- `/client/src/styles/category-filters.css`

## Testing Checklist
