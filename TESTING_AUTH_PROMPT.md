# Testing Auth-Required State in Prediction Details

## How to Test the Changes

### Current Behavior
When a user is **not authenticated** and views a prediction details page:
- They should see an auth-required prompt **immediately** 
- The prompt should show: "Sign in to place your bet"
- They should NOT see the betting options or stake input

### Testing Steps

1. **Clear your browser cache and cookies**
   - This ensures you're not logged in from a previous session

2. **Open your app in an incognito/private window**
   - This is the easiest way to test as an unauthenticated user

3. **Navigate to any prediction details page**
   - Example: `/prediction/{any-prediction-id}`

4. **Expected Result**
   - You should see the auth-required prompt in place of the betting interface
   - The prompt should have:
     - TrendingUp icon
     - Title: "Sign in to place your bet"
     - Description: "Create an account or sign in to make predictions and win rewards."
     - Green "Sign In" button

5. **After signing in**
   - You should see the full betting interface with options and stake input

### If Changes Are Not Visible

1. **Restart your dev server**
   ```bash
   # Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
   # Then restart
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

2. **Clear React/Vite cache**
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules/.vite
   ```

3. **Hard refresh in browser**
   - Windows/Linux: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
   - Mac: `Cmd + Shift + R`

4. **Check the console for errors**
   - Open browser DevTools (F12)
   - Look for any errors related to `PredictionActionPanel` or `AuthRequiredState`

### Visual Comparison

**BEFORE (Old Behavior):**
- User sees betting options even when not logged in
- Only shows auth prompt AFTER selecting an option

**AFTER (New Behavior):**
- User sees auth prompt IMMEDIATELY when not logged in
- Betting options are hidden until they sign in

### Debug: Check Authentication State

Add this temporarily to see what's happening:

In `PredictionDetailsPageV2.tsx`, add a console log:
```typescript
console.log('Auth state:', { isAuthenticated, user });
```

This will show you whether the app thinks you're authenticated or not.

### Files Modified
1. `/client/src/components/prediction/PredictionActionPanel.tsx` - Shows auth prompt immediately
2. `/client/src/pages/PredictionDetailsPageV2.tsx` - Already passes `isAuthenticated` prop correctly

The changes are in place and should work once you test as an unauthenticated user.
