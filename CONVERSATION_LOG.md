## Key Conversations & Updates

### React Architecture Debugging & Error Fixes (Current Session)
- **Date**: [Current Date]
- **Focus**: Fixing "o is not a function" error in DiscoverPage.tsx and related TypeScript issues
- **Root Cause Analysis**: The error was caused by:
  1. Missing `refreshPredictions` method in predictionStore.ts
  2. Missing `lockFunds` method in walletStore.ts 
  3. Incomplete interface definitions after terminology update
  4. Function call mismatches between components and stores

#### Key Fixes Applied:

**1. PredictionStore Updates**
- âœ… Added missing `refreshPredictions` method with proper caching logic
- âœ… Fixed `placePrediction` method signature to match usage in components
- âœ… Updated interface to include all required methods
- âœ… Improved error handling and fallback mechanisms

**2. WalletStore Updates**
- âœ… Added missing `lockFunds` method for prediction placement
- âœ… Enhanced wallet initialization with demo balance fallback ($1000)
- âœ… Fixed transaction recording and balance management
- âœ… Improved error handling for insufficient funds scenarios

**3. PlacePredictionModal Fixes**
- âœ… Fixed missing function imports and declarations
- âœ… Added proper error handling for user authentication
- âœ… Implemented correct wallet integration with lockFunds
- âœ… Fixed formatTimeRemaining function implementation

**4. Component Architecture Improvements**
- âœ… Enhanced error boundaries and fallback states
- âœ… Improved TypeScript type safety across all components
- âœ… Fixed circular dependency issues
- âœ… Added proper loading and error states

### Initial Setup (Previous Session)
- **Date**: [Previous Date]
- **Focus**: Project introduction and context establishment
- **Key Points**:
  - Reviewed comprehensive project documentation
  - Confirmed project structure and current status
  - Established that all work should default to Fan Club Z v2.0 context
  - Created intro summary for future conversation context

### Terminology Update (Previous Session)
- **Date**: [Previous Date]
- **Focus**: Major terminology update throughout platform
- **Key Changes**:
  - Updated all "betting" terminology to "predictions" for broader palatability
  - Created comprehensive terminology guide for implementation
  - Updated main project documentation with new terminology
  - This affects UI, API endpoints, database schema, and all user-facing content
- **Rationale**: Make platform more accessible and less intimidating to mainstream users

### Comprehensive UI/UX Style Guide Creation (Previous Session)
- **Date**: July 27, 2025
- **Focus**: Complete UI/UX design system documentation
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - Comprehensive style guide incorporating iTunes/Robinhood aesthetics
  - Social engagement patterns from X/Twitter and WhatsApp
  - Detailed component library with all variants and states
  - Advanced animation system and micro-interactions
  - Psychological engagement triggers (subtly implemented)
  - Dark mode implementation guidelines
  - Advanced responsive design patterns
  - Complete accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA)
  - Performance optimization guidelines

---

## Technical Decisions Made
- **State Management**: Zustand chosen for simplicity and performance
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui with custom green theme (#22c55e)
- **Architecture**: Microservices with PostgreSQL + Redis + smart contracts
- **Mobile-First**: Bottom navigation, touch-optimized interactions
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error boundaries with graceful fallbacks
- **Demo Data**: Wallet starts with $1000 for immediate user testing
