### 🔄 **CI/CD Pipeline**

#### **Automated Deployment**
```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
name: Deploy to Production
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  deploy-client:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Deploy to Vercel
        # Vercel deployment steps
  
  deploy-server:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Deploy to Render
        # Render deployment steps
```
