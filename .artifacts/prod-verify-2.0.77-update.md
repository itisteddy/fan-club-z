- [ ] **Seamless auth gating** for all write actions
- [ ] **Resume-after-auth** works for all actions
- [ ] **No console errors** in production
- [ ] **Mobile experience** is smooth and intuitive
- [ ] **Performance** is fast and responsive

## 🔄 Rollback Plan

If any critical issues are found:
1. **Vercel**: Revert to previous deployment
2. **Render**: Rollback to last stable backend version
3. **Cache**: Clear browser cache and service worker
4. **Monitor**: Check error logs and user feedback
