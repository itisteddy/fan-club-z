git commit -m "fix: comprehensive software architecture debugging fixes

✅ ISSUE #1: Fixed username click navigation in prediction details
- Enhanced TappableUsername component with robust error handling
- Added proper creator data structure handling with fallbacks
- Fixed profile navigation routing for all user data variations

✅ ISSUE #2: Removed all mock data from likes and comments
- Like store now uses 100% real Supabase data with persistence
- Comment store uses real database with proper synchronization
- Removed fallback mock data that was causing inconsistencies

✅ ISSUE #3: Fixed analytics and statistics calculations
- PredictionDetailsPage now displays real pool totals and participant counts
- Removed hardcoded analytics values
- Added dynamic calculation from actual database values

✅ ISSUE #4: Fixed platform stats API endpoint
- Enhanced platform stats calculation in server
- Real-time volume calculation from actual prediction pools
- Live user count and active prediction counting

✅ ISSUE #5: Centralized version management
- Created single source of truth configuration (config/index.ts)
- Eliminated hardcoded version strings across codebase
- Consistent version display throughout application

✅ ISSUE #6: Resolved TypeScript compilation issues
- Fixed import paths and module resolution
- Updated type definitions for consistency
- Clean server compilation without errors

🎯 IMPACT:
- Username navigation now works perfectly across all pages
- Social features (likes/comments) are fully persistent and real
- Platform statistics show actual live data
- Version consistency maintained automatically
- No TypeScript compilation errors
- Preserved all existing user experience while fixing architecture
