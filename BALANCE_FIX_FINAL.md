# ACTUAL FIX - Balance Not Displaying

## The Real Problem

The wallet balance was showing **$0.00** on the prediction details page even though the user had **$150,016,000** in their wallet.

### Root Cause

**Zustand Getter Access Issue**

The problem was in how we were accessing the computed `balance` property from the Zustand store:

```typescript
// ❌ WRONG - This gets the getter function, not the value
const { balance: walletBalance } = useWalletStore();

// ✅ CORRECT - This calls the getter and gets the actual value
const walletStore = useWalletStore();
const walletBalance = walletStore.balance;
```

### Why This Happened

Zustand's computed properties (getters) need to be accessed directly on the store object, not destructured. When you destructure them, you get the getter function itself, which doesn't automatically execute.

The wallet store had this:
```typescript
get balance() {
  const state = get();
  const usdBalance = state.balances.find(b => b.currency === 'USD');
  return usdBalance?.available || 0;
}
```

When destructuring `{ balance }`, we were getting the getter function.  
When accessing `store.balance`, the getter executes and returns the value.

## The Fix

### File: `/client/src/pages/PredictionDetailsPageV2.tsx`

**Changed:**
```typescript
// Before
const { getBalance, initializeWallet, balance: walletBalance, balances } = useWalletStore();

// After
const walletStore = useWalletStore();
const { getBalance, initializeWallet, balances } = walletStore;
const walletBalance = walletStore.balance; // Accesses the getter correctly
```

**Enhanced balance calculation with fallback:**
```typescript
const userBalance = useMemo(() => {
  if (!isAuthenticated) {
    console.log('💰 Not authenticated, returning 0');
    return 0;
  }
  
  const balance = typeof walletBalance === 'number' && !isNaN(walletBalance) 
    ? walletBalance 
    : 0;
  
  // Fallback to balances array if getter fails
  const balanceFromArray = balances.find(b => b.currency === 'USD')?.available || 0;
  
  console.log('💰 Balance calculation:', { 
    walletBalance,
    balanceFromArray,
    finalBalance: balance || balanceFromArray,
    formatted: `$${(balance || balanceFromArray).toLocaleString()}`
  });
  
  return balance || balanceFromArray;
}, [isAuthenticated, walletBalance, balances]);
```

## Test Results

With the fix:
- ✅ Balance now shows **$150,016,000** (or $150M formatted)
- ✅ Users can place bets when they have sufficient funds
- ✅ Button shows "Insufficient Balance" when stake exceeds available funds
- ✅ Balance updates in real-time when wallet changes

## Other Fixes Applied

1. **Category Pills Height** - Reduced from 36px to 28px ✅
2. **Button Positioning** - Increased z-index and padding to stay above nav ✅  
3. **Onboarding Tutorial** - Removed broken references ✅
4. **Balance Display** - Added prominent balance card ✅

## Files Modified

- `/client/src/pages/PredictionDetailsPageV2.tsx` - Fixed getter access
- `/client/src/components/prediction/PredictionActionPanel.tsx` - Enhanced UI
- `/client/src/config/onboardingTours.tsx` - Fixed broken refs
- `/client/src/styles/category-filters.css` - Reduced pill height

**Issue:** Balance showing $0 instead of $150M  
**Cause:** Zustand getter not being called properly  
**Fix:** Access getter directly on store object  
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED
