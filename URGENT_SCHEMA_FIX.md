# URGENT Database Schema Fix Applied

## Issue
The production Supabase database schema was missing the `participant_count` column that our code was trying to insert, causing prediction creation to fail.

## Root Cause
- Development schema had `participant_count` field
- Production schema doesn't have this field
- Code was also adding unnecessary timestamp fields

## Fix Applied
### Removed from prediction payload:
- `participant_count: 0` (field doesn't exist in production DB)
- `created_at: new Date().toISOString()` (handled by DB triggers)
- `updated_at: new Date().toISOString()` (handled by DB triggers)

### Cleaned prediction options payload:
- Removed manual timestamp fields
- Simplified to only required fields

### Result:
Prediction creation payload now matches the actual production database schema.

## Files Modified
- `/client/src/stores/predictionStore.ts` - Cleaned up prediction creation payload

## Next Steps
1. The fix is being auto-deployed to Render
2. Test prediction creation after deployment completes (~3 minutes)
3. If working, consider adding the participant_count field to production DB if needed
4. Update schema documentation to match production reality

## Status
ðŸš€ **DEPLOYED** - Auto-deployment triggered via git push
