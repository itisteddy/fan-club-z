# CRITICAL FIXES - September 29, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Balance Not Displaying Correctly
**Problem:** User balance showed as $0.00 even when funds were available in wallet

**Root Cause:** 
- Wrong component was being modified (BetDetailPage vs PredictionDetailsPageV2)
- Balance was being incorrectly divided by 100 (assuming cents) when wallet store already returns in dollars
- Wallet wasn't being initialized on the prediction details page

**Solution:**
- Updated `PredictionDetailsPageV2.tsx` to use balance directly from wallet store (no conversion)
- Added wallet initialization when user is authenticated
- Enhanced `PredictionActionPanel.tsx` to show prominent balance display card at top
- Added real-time validation showing "Insufficient funds" warning

**Files Modified:**
- `/client/src/pages/PredictionDetailsPageV2.tsx`
- `/client/src/components/prediction/PredictionActionPanel.tsx`

### 2. ‚úÖ Place Bet Button Hidden Behind Bottom Navigation
**Problem:** Button partially hidden/covered by bottom navigation bar

**Solution:**
- Updated action panel container z-index from 20 to 35 (higher than bottom nav's 30)
- Changed bottom padding from `calc(4rem + env(safe-area-inset-bottom))` to `calc(5rem + env(safe-area-inset-bottom))`
- Added white background and shadow to action panel for better visibility
- Added z-index: 10 to the Place Bet button itself for additional layering
- Enhanced button styling with gradient, shadow, and larger size (py-4 rounded-xl)

**Files Modified:**
- `/client/src/pages/PredictionDetailsPageV2.tsx`
- `/client/src/components/prediction/PredictionActionPanel.tsx`

### 3. ‚úÖ Onboarding Tutorial Updated
**Problem:** Tutorial referenced non-existent UI elements

**Solution:**
- Removed "live-markets" target (doesn't exist)
- Updated PREDICTION_DETAILS_TOUR to match current UI flow
- Simplified to modal-based approach for better UX
- Updated descriptions to match actual interface

**Files Modified:**
- `/client/src/config/onboardingTours.tsx`

### 4. ‚úÖ Category Filter Pills Too Tall
**Problem:** Pills were 36px/32px tall, wasting vertical space

**Solution:**
- Reduced to 28px (desktop) / 26px (mobile)
- Adjusted padding and font sizes proportionally
- Maintained readability and visual balance

**Files Modified:**
- `/client/src/styles/category-filters.css`

## Additional Improvements Made

### Enhanced Balance Display
- **Large, prominent balance card** at top of betting section
- Gradient background (emerald-50 to teal-50) for visual prominence
- Icon with balance label for clarity
- Shows balance in large, bold text ($X,XXX.XX format)

### Better Button Validation
- Shows "Insufficient Balance" when stake exceeds available funds
- Shows "Enter Valid Amount" for zero or negative stakes
- Disabled state with clear visual feedback (gray background)
- Active state with attractive gradient and hover effects

### Improved Visual Hierarchy
- Betting panel now has clear z-index layering
- White background with shadow for depth
- Better spacing to prevent overlap with navigation
- Enhanced button with gradient, larger size, and active states
