# Balance Display Issue - Root Cause Analysis

## The Problem
Your console shows: `Balance: 150016000`  
But this should display as: `$1,500,160.00`

## Root Cause
The database is storing balances in **cents** (smallest currency unit), which is actually a GOOD practice for financial applications to avoid floating-point precision issues. However, the frontend needs to properly convert this for display.

## The Math
```
Database value: 150016000 (cents)
Divided by 100: 1500160 (dollars)
Formatted: $1,500,160.00
```

## Solutions

### Option 1: Fix at Display Layer (RECOMMENDED)
The wallet store returns the raw value from the database. We should format it for display in the UI components.

### Option 2: Fix at Store Layer
Convert cents to dollars when retrieving from database in the wallet store.

### Option 3: Database Migration
Change the database schema to store dollars instead of cents (NOT RECOMMENDED for production).

## Immediate Fix for PredictionActionPanel

The component already expects the balance in dollars, so we need to convert it:

```typescript
// In PredictionDetailsPageV2.tsx
const userBalance = useMemo(() => {
  if (!isAuthenticated) return 0;
  
  // Get balance (this is in cents from database)
  let balanceInCents = 0;
  
  if (typeof walletBalance === 'number' && !isNaN(walletBalance)) {
    balanceInCents = walletBalance;
  } else {
    const usdBalance = balances.find(b => b.currency === 'USD');
    balanceInCents = usdBalance?.available || 0;
  }
  
  // Convert cents to dollars for display
  const balanceInDollars = balanceInCents / 100;
  
  console.log('ðŸ’° Balance conversion:', {
    cents: balanceInCents,
    dollars: balanceInDollars,
    formatted: `$${balanceInDollars.toLocaleString()}`
  });
  
  return balanceInDollars;
}, [isAuthenticated, walletBalance, balances]);
```

## Why This Happens

Financial applications typically store monetary values as integers (cents) because:
1. **Precision**: Avoids floating-point rounding errors
2. **Performance**: Integer math is faster than decimal
3. **Standards**: Payment processors (Stripe, etc.) use cents

Example:
```javascript
// BAD (floating point issues)
0.1 + 0.2 === 0.3  // false! (JavaScript quirk)

// GOOD (integer math)
10 + 20 === 30  // true!
// Then divide by 100 for display: 30 / 100 = $0.30
```

## Check Your Database Schema

Run this query to see how balances are stored:

```sql
SELECT 
  available_balance, 
  reserved_balance, 
  total_deposited 
FROM wallets 
WHERE user_id = 'your-user-id'
LIMIT 1;
```

If values are in millions, they're stored as cents.

## The Fix I'm Implementing

I'll update the component to convert the balance properly when displaying it.
