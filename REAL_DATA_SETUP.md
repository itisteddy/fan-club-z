# 🚀 Real Data Setup Guide for Fan Club Z

This guide will help you set up real Supabase authentication with meaningful seeded data for production testing.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- ✅ Supabase project configured
- ✅ Environment variables set in Vercel
- ✅ Database schema created

## 🔧 Step 1: Create Real Test Users

First, we need to create real users in Supabase Auth with proper credentials:

```bash
cd server
npm run db:create-users
```

This will create 5 test users with the following credentials:

### 👥 Test User Accounts

| Email | Password | Role | Name |
|-------|----------|------|------|
| `admin@fanclubz.com` | `TestPassword123!` | Admin | Admin User |
| `john.doe@fanclubz.com` | `TestPassword123!` | User | John Doe |
| `jane.smith@fanclubz.com` | `TestPassword123!` | User | Jane Smith |
| `mike.wilson@fanclubz.com` | `TestPassword123!` | User | Mike Wilson |
| `sarah.jones@fanclubz.com` | `TestPassword123!` | User | Sarah Jones |

## 🌱 Step 2: Seed Database with Real Data

After creating the users, seed the database with meaningful content:

```bash
npm run db:seed
```

This will create:
- ✅ User profiles for all authenticated users
- ✅ Wallets with realistic balances
- ✅ 5 contextually meaningful clubs
- ✅ 5 active predictions with realistic odds
- ✅ Club memberships and interactions
- ✅ Comments and reactions
- ✅ Transaction history

## 🎯 Step 3: Test Real Authentication

Now you can test the application with real Supabase authentication:

1. **Visit your deployed app**: https://fanclubz-version-2-0.vercel.app
2. **Login with any test account** (e.g., `john.doe@fanclubz.com` / `TestPassword123!`)
3. **Explore the real data**:
   - Browse clubs and predictions
   - Join clubs and make predictions
   - Interact with other users' content

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Email Validation Issues
If you encounter email validation errors:
- Use the provided test emails (they're properly formatted)
- Ensure Supabase email settings allow these domains
- Check that email confirmation is enabled

### Database Connection Issues
If seeding fails:
